# 简单动态规划算法

- this project is a simple practice about Dynamaic Programming

## description
- A triangle of data is provided, you have to calculate the maximum sum from top layer to bottom layer along a continuous track.

## method 
- Dynamic Programming tend to record the former calculate-result in a array, so we can reduce the repeat

## run this project

```
cd dp_example
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
```
